description: Every day, Chris – and her curious toddler at the time – would walk to the church bells for a daily song. As his fascination for bells grew, he inspired a family road trip to see one of America’s largest carillon bell towers. <br/><br/> <img src="../img/Inspiration_Bell.jpg" onload="this.width/=2;"/> <br/>Moreover, he inspired Chris to write his namesake picture book Teddy Lou, Bell Guru! Her kids give Chris a chance to see the world with fresh eyes… and spark inspiration for new stories along the way! Happy reading!
